  You can redeploy your modified code on Vercel easily. Follow these steps:

1. Commit Your Changes (Recommended)
   If your project is linked to GitHub, commit your changes:

sh
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Updated code"
git push origin main
Vercel will automatically deploy the latest changes if the project is linked to GitHub.

2. Redeploy Using Vercel CLI (If Not Using GitHub)
   If you deployed manually using Vercel CLI, just run:

sh
Copy
Edit
vercel --prod
This will redeploy your project with the latest changes.

3. Check Your Live URL
   Once deployed, visit:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://your-project-name.vercel.app
Your updated portfolio should be live! 🚀
